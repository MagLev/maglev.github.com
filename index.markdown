# MagLev

MagLev is a fast, stable, Ruby implementation with integrated object
persistence and distributed shared cache.

MagLev is a 64-bit open source (MIT licensed) implementation of
the Ruby programming language and libraries built on top of VMware's
GemStone/S 3.1 Virtual Machine.

The MagLev VM takes full advantage of GemStone/S JIT to native code
performance, distributed shared cache, fully ACID transactions, and
enterprise class NoSQL data management capabilities to provide a
robust and durable programming platform. It can transparently manage
a much larger amount (terabytes) of data and code than will fit in memory.
There are no restrictions on what types of objects, classes, blocks,
threads or continuations that can be stored and executed.

MagLev 1.0.0 was released on October 31, 2011.

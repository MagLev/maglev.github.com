# Further Reading

Since MagLev is built on the same VM as the GemStone/S Smalltalk product,
the following documents may be of interest:

1. [System Administration Guide for GemStone/S 64 Bit](http://community.gemstone.com/download/attachments/6816350/GS64-SysAdminGuide-3.0.pdf?version=1)
   For information on configuring and managing the Stone and VMs.
1. [GemStone/S 64 Bit Topaz Programming Environment](http://community.gemstone.com/download/attachments/6816350/GS64-Topaz-3.0.pdf?version=1)
   Topaz is the built-in debugging environment for the VM.
1. [GemStone/S 64 Bit Programming Guide](http://community.gemstone.com/download/attachments/6816350/GS64-ProgGuide-3.0.pdf?version=1)
   Even though it is presented in the context of Smalltalk, this is a good
   source for programming concepts related to transactions and indexed
   collections.
